If you would like to replace cshsh with bash under CAEN Linux, you'll want to
update two files. You need to replace the CAEN .cshrc with the one provided
here and you'll want a starter .bashrc.

NOTE: Both of the files in this directory are missing the leading "." so you
can see them with 'ls'. For these files to be used, they need the leading "."

("dotfiles" are also called "hidden files" and can be seen with 'ls -a')

Thus when you replace these files, you should execute something like:

mv bashrc /path/to/your/home/directory/.bashrc


As always, be careful messing with login scripts as you can break things.
